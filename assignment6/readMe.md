## Simple Application: Product Inventory Management System
# This simple application will manage a list of products in an inventory. It will demonstrate the use of variables, data types, control flow statements, arrays, objects, and asynchronous features.

# Summary
This small project implements a basic product inventory management system with the following features:

Form for Adding Products: Users can add products to the inventory by filling out a form with the product name and price.
Dynamic Product List: The list of products is dynamically updated as users add or remove products. Each product entry includes a name, price, and a button to remove the product from the list.
Asynchronous Feature: The application simulates fetching initial products from a server using an asynchronous function (fetchInitialProducts). This demonstrates the use of async/await to handle asynchronous operations.
Challenges Encountered
DOM Manipulation: Ensuring that the DOM updates correctly when products are added or removed required careful manipulation of the product list.
Asynchronous Operations: Simulating asynchronous data fetching involved using async/await and ensuring the UI updates correctly once the data is "fetched."
User Input Handling: Validating and processing user input to prevent errors and ensure a smooth user experience was crucial.
Overall, this project demonstrates essential JavaScript concepts and provides a foundation for more complex applications.
