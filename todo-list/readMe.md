To-Do List
This interactive webpage allows users to manage a to-do list. It uses an array to store the list items and DOM manipulation to display them. Users can add new items through an input field and a button, and the list updates dynamically when a new item is added.

Summary
This simple to-do list application includes the following features:

Form for Adding Items: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering text into an input field and clicking an "Add" button.
Dynamic List Display: The list of tasks is dynamically updated as users add or remove items.
Remove Items: Each task in the list has a "Remove" button that allows users to delete the task from the list.
Challenges
DOM Manipulation: Ensuring that the DOM correctly reflects changes in the array required careful updating and clearing of list elements.
Event Handling: Properly handling form submissions and button clicks involved setting up and managing multiple event listeners.
