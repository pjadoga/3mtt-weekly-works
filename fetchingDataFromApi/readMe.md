Comparison of Approaches
Promises:

Readability: Using promises, we chain .then() and .catch() methods to handle asynchronous operations. This can become cumbersome and less readable with multiple chained operations, often referred to as "callback hell."
Error Handling: Errors are caught using .catch(), which is straightforward but can be less intuitive when dealing with complex flows.
Async/Await:

Readability: Async/await syntax makes the asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, which is generally easier to read and understand. The flow of execution is more straightforward, reducing the cognitive load.
Error Handling: Error handling is done using try/catch blocks, which are more familiar to those accustomed to traditional synchronous error handling in JavaScript.
Reflection on Debugging Asynchronous Issues
Debugging asynchronous issues can be challenging due to the non-blocking nature of JavaScript. To debug the asynchronous issues in this project:

Console Logging: I used console.log statements to trace the flow of execution and inspect the state at various points.
Network Tab: The browser's developer tools network tab was helpful to verify the API request and response, ensuring the correct data was being fetched.
Error Messages: Clear and descriptive error messages helped identify issues, especially when fetching the API data.
Switching between promises and async/await provided insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Ultimately, I found the async/await syntax more readable and easier to manage, particularly for complex asynchronous flows
